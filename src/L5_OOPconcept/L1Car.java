        (Output Explanation) Reference vs. Primitive Types

         Reference Types (e.g., String): A reference type variable stores a referenceâ€”a memory address that points to an object's actual location on the heap.
         The variable itself does not contain the object's data. If a reference variable does not point to any object, its value is the special literal null. This applies to all objects, including strings, arrays etc.

         Primitive Types (e.g., int): A primitive type variable directly contains its value within its own allocated memory space.
         A primitive variable can never be null. If declared as a class field without initialization, primitives are assigned a default value, such
         - byte: 0
         - short: 0
         - int: 0
         - long: 0
         - char: 0

         - float: 0.0
         - double: 0.0

         - boolean: false
